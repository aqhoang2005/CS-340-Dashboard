# CS-340-Dashboard
Animal Center Dashboard Project for CS-340

#Project Description
This project is an Animal Shelter database for the Austin Animal Center that manages animals of different breeds and ages with authenticated admin user(s). The project also demonstrates the creator’s knowledge of CRUD principles in Python, database modification, and MongoDB in CS-340 Client/Server Development.







#Reflection Questions
1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Programs that are maintable, readable, and adaptable have good comments that describe functions in a concise manner, while also having functions that are ready for change at any moment. There are also coding standards for coding languages that helps with users being able to follow and read what each line of code does in your program. An advantage of working on a project in this way is that the classes and methods from CRUD are universal and can be applied in any project of any context such as a music or video game database.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I typically approach every problem as a computer scientist with my own experience in mind, trying to apply what I learned or used in the past to current situations, even if the mediums or situation is different. The approach for this project was vastly different as I never used Jupyter Notebook before, nor did I have much experience with Python. Since I had no past experience to reflect on, I had to rely on the given course materials to guide me on challenges with the project. In the future, I would research more on what tools or programs I would be given to work with and if the tools are something I am familiar with, I would find ways to optimize functions better while trying to meet client requests.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are not just software programmers or data analysts, but they also design systems and resarch new ideas to innovate from. Computer scientists matter not just because they can create programs and code, but also because of their problem solving skills with technology and with the growing advent of AI and machine learning, they are crucial for future technologies now and yet to come. My work on this project helped Grazioso to have an easy way of finding animals from Austin Animal Center to train for search-and-rescues. The principles from this project can be applied to any other context, looking for certain entities that have attributes that fit certain criteria.
